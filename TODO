Other:
    ☐ @low `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` should be a setting and not hardcoded (https://github.com/countnazgul/qlBuilder/issues/20)
    ☐ reload progress - script tuning (https://github.com/countnazgul/qlBuilder/issues/19) @high 
    ☐ @medium (not problem with `qlbuilder` itself but ...) sometimes when `session.txt` is present `qlik-sense-authenticate` is complaning ... lowdly 
    ☐ @low validate JSON schema - config.yml?
    ☐ @low make sure that the workflow works ok with the other auth methods
        ☐ cert

Testing: 
    ☐ more test scripts to be added
    ☐ quick check with Linux environment

Features:
    ☐ `include` / `must_include` - generate script function with the actual code and call the function instead of the statement
    ☐ different way(s) to organise the script files. Functional approach? config?
